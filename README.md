# inline-markdown-editor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor) ![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/publiclab/inline-markdown-editor/badges/gpa.svg)

An inline wysiwyg markdown document editor based on replacing string subsections. WYSIWYG possible via the [woofmark](https://github.com/bevacqua/woofmark)-based [PublicLab.Editor](https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor).

## Basics

`inline-markdown-editor` splits up a Markdown-containing string by double newlines into sections, and parses each into HTML, which it displays.

It then adds an "edit button" beneath each section, which expands a nice form for editing that section either as Markdown or in rich text with a WYSIWYG editor.

Upon submitting the form, an asynchronous AJAX post request is made to the specified server with parameters `before` and `after`, containing the original subsection markdown and its replacement. The form listens for a `true` or `false` response and updates the section's displayed HTML accordingly.

For a demo, see:

## Usage

For an easy start, you can begin using `inline-markdown-editor` by pointing it at a markdown-containing element by its selector, and specifying a URL to send changes to.

```js
inlineMarkdownEditor({
  replaceUrl: '/wiki/replace/',
  selector: '.markdown'
});
```

You can also specify filters to run on the raw original markdown before display, and afterwards upon the displayed DOM element, as well as override several other defaults:

```js
inlineMarkdownEditor({
  replaceUrl: '/wiki/replace/' + wiki_id,
  selector: '.markdown',
  preProcessor: function preProcessMarkdown(markdown) {
    // do things to markdown here before it's used to construct the form
    return markdown
  },
  postProcessor: function postProcessContent(element) {
    // do things to element here after the section has been converted to HTML and displayed
  },
  defaultMarkdown: function(markdown) {}, // a markdown parser
  buildSectionForm: function() {}, // return a string containing the form element
  onComplete: function(response, markdown, html, el, uniqueId, form, o) {}, // run on completing AJAX post
  isEditable: function(markdown) {}, // returns boolean; whether a given subsection should get an inline form; default skips HTML and horizontal rules
  extraButtons: { 'fa-icon-name': function(element) {} }, // object with keys of icon names for additional buttons with associated actions for each; returns jQuery element upon construction
  submitSectionForm: function(event, before, after, options) {}, // optional, to override the form submission handling for each subsection; before/after represent the text diff
  editorOptions: {} // any options to pass to the built-in PublicLab.Editor instance
});
```

## Contributing

To install this library for development, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). You can get the detailed instruction on installing node and npm in its official [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).

After installing node and npm run `npm install` from the root directory.

`inline-markdown-editor` uses grunt - the JavaScript task runner - for compilation of the modules. To install grunt run `npm install -g grunt-cli`. You may have to use `sudo` for root privileges.

Make changes to the files in the `/src/` directory, then run `grunt build` to compile into `/dist/in  lineMarkdownEditor.js`. This will use `grunt-browserify` to concatenate and include any node modules named in `require()` statements. You'll then be able to try it out in `/examples/index.html`. Run `grunt` and leave it running to build as you go.

## Tests

Tests are set up with Jasmine, and can be run with `npm test`.

## Goals

* configurable editors
* plan for swappable editors; will need to specify both constructor and onEditorSubmit in processSection
* better modularization of processSection.js
* more tests

## Tests we want

* defaultMarkdown
* preProcessor
* postProcessor
* insertForm: look for the form, the button
